Hi, this is my Frontend test.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6, Typescript, SASS & NGRX.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

For test the components (Jasmine), run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via the runner [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
